								<h2 class="mb-5 tm-video-title"> Berkeley AI: Pacman  </h2>
								<p class="mb-4"> <a href="https://markmcateer.pythonanywhere.com/">(Original Assignment)</a> </p>
							
							    <h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-3 tm-catalog-item-title"> Introduction </h3>
								<p class="mb-4"> The Berkeley AI Pacman project is a course long project used at many universities across the globe.
								In the course I took at UCSC, CSE140: Artifical Intelligence, my professor broke the assignemnt into four parts. The first
								three parts consisted of individual work while the final part consisted of teamwork in a group of four. 	 </p> 

								<h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-3 tm-catalog-item-title"> Part 1 </h3>
								<h5> Overview </h5>
								<p class="mb-4"> Part One of the project consisted of writing multiple search algorithms: Depth First Search, Breath First Search,
								 Uniform Cost Search, A* search. The search algorithms are incorporated with the pacman code so that the pacman agent 
								will traverse through each layout using the path provided by running the algorithm.   </p> 

								<h5> Algorithm Descriptions </h5>
								<p class="mb-4"> Following the steps of other stock trading platforms such as Robinhood, I decided to use python for writing 
									the backend code. This allowed for an easier creation of data structures and coding in general than what would 
									have been my second choice, C++. To get my python code onto a website I decided to once again follow 
									the steps of Robinhood and use Django. After learning the basics of Django, the transfer of the python 
									code onto a website was a simple transition.  </p> 

									<h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-3 tm-catalog-item-title"> Part 2 </h3>
									<h5> Overview </h5>
									<p class="mb-4"> I created the Trade Simulator to practice my trading skills in a risk free environment. 
										I began creating this by doing research on financial APIs and which ones had the best free tier. 
										I originally used Alpha Vantage API but ran into some issues so I decided to go with the polygon.io API. 
										This did include some limitations such as a max data history of 2 years as well as 5 API pulls per minute. 
										One of the main problems I faced was that when a user interacted with the page, the data would be pulled from the API 
										multiple times within one minute. This caused the page to crash, so I decided to cache the stock data and retrieve it 
										from the cache when the page updated.  </p>

								<h5> Libraries </h5>
								<p class="mb-4"> Libraries that I used for the project included Pickle for storing username and password information,
									NumPy for storing data and regression calculations, and Plotly and matplotlib for graphing.  </p>
