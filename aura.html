                                    Aura is a top-down RPG built using Unreal Engine's Gameplay Ability System (GAS). Designed primarily for a solo player experience, it also supports multiplayer functionality. Players control Aura, casting spells, battling enemies, and leveling up attributes and skills to grow stronger.
                                    This project extensively utilizes Gameplay Effects, Gameplay Tags, Gameplay Attributes, Gameplay Cues, and all core aspects of GAS. I developed Aura by following an online course with over 100 hours of video content, applying what I learned to create a fully functional RPG system.

                        <p class="mb-4"> Currently, the project features one implemented attack spell: the fireball. 
                            This spell is built upon a custom projectile parent class that I developed, 
                            which itself inherits from a gameplay ability parent class. The fireball follows Unreal 
                            Engine’s Gameplay Ability System (GAS) structure, ensuring modularity and scalability for future abilities.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4"> The SpawnProjectile function is responsible for spawning projectiles while
                            ensuring execution only occurs on the server by checking for authority. It determines the
                            spawn location via the combat interface, calculates the appropriate rotation toward the target,
                            and applies an optional pitch override if specified. A transform is then created using these values,
                            and the projectile is spawned using SpawnActorDeferred< AAuraProjectile >(), allowing modifications
                            before finalization.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Once the projectile is instantiated, a gameplay effect context is created using the ability 
                            system component, linking it to the ability and projectile. Relevant hit results and source
                            objects are added for tracking, and an outgoing gameplay effect spec is generated to define the 
                            damage properties. The function then iterates through DamageTypes, scaling damage values based on 
                            the ability level and assigning them accordingly. Finally, the projectile stores this effect spec
                            handle and completes its spawn process via FinishSpawning().

                            Aura, and the other actor, the enemy, using GetDistanceTo. It then calculates the 
                            distance and determines if the two actors are close enough and the enemies can “see” Aura. 
                            The blackboard values are set are passed to the behavior tree to make the decision of whether to go to Aura.

                            The behavior tree then checks if the enemy is alive, if the enemy has a target, and if the enemy is 
                            hit reacting. If these checks pass the selector checks whether the enemy is a ranged attacker, melee
                            attacker and the distance to Aura. If an enemy is a Melee attacker then the distance to attack 
                            will be less than that of a ranged attacker. The selector knows what type of attacker an enemy is
                            by checking its Gameplay Tag set on the enemies blueprint.

                        <p class="mb-4"> A key gameplay mechanic in Archipelago is the player's ability to navigate through the floating islands.
                            To enhance this we came up with the idea of a dash ability where pressing the RMB propels the player forward.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4"> The player has access to three dashes, which reset upon landing or when they collide with an orb.
                            These orbs, floating spheres scattered between the islands, trigger time dilation when the player dashes into them, allowing them a brief moment to aim their next dash.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4"> The dash functionality was implemented by modifying the jump mechanic and adjusting its values.
                            Instead of the traditional up-and-down motion, the dash propels the player forward by a fixed distance.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4"> The orbs themselves are pawns with collision spheres, and when the player intersects with them,
                            time dilation activates for a few seconds, giving the player time to strategize their next move.

                        <p class="mb-4"> A key gameplay mechanic in Archipelago is the player's ability to navigate through the floating islands.
                            To enhance this we came up with the idea of a dash ability where pressing the RMB propels the player forward.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4"> The player has access to three dashes, which reset upon landing or when they collide with an orb.
                            These orbs, floating spheres scattered between the islands, trigger time dilation when the player dashes into them, allowing them a brief moment to aim their next dash.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4"> The dash functionality was implemented by modifying the jump mechanic and adjusting its values.
                            Instead of the traditional up-and-down motion, the dash propels the player forward by a fixed distance.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-4"> The orbs themselves are pawns with collision spheres, and when the player intersects with them,
                            time dilation activates for a few seconds, giving the player time to strategize their next move.
