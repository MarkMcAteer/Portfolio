								<h1 class="mb-5 tm-video-title"> Abstract Data Types (ADT)  </h1>
							
							    <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-3 tm-catalog-item-title"> Overview </h2>
								<p class="mb-4"> In this assignment we were tasked with creating 4 different sorting algorithms and a dynamically
									allocated array of pseudo randomly generated numbers to test each with. </p> 

								<h5> List ADT </h5>
								<p class="mb-4">This program will utilize the List ADT by sorting an array of words. The array of words is taken line by line from an
                                    input file and organized, alphabetically, having sorted indices stored in the List ADT. The sorted list of words will
                                    then be printed to the output file. This program accepts the command line arguments:  ./Lex < inputfile > < outputfile >
                                    after being compiled. It will simply sort the input file and send the sorted words to the output file. </p> 

								<h5> Graph ADT </h5>
								<p class="mb-4"> This program will utilize the Graph and List ADTs. It first takes an input file and output file as paramters,
                                    exiting if an invalid number of arguments are made. The input file will contain the number of vertices on the
                                    first line, followed by pairs of edges and searches to run which can be terminated with an input "0 0".
                                    After recieving input, the program will create an undirected graph which can then be searched through
                                    by the breath first search algorithm. The output is printed to outfile and will consist of the adjacency
                                    list representation along with the shortest possible paths specificed in the infile.  </p> 

								<h5> Matrix ADT </h5>
								<p class="mb-4"> This program will utilize the Matrix Abstract Data type with a unqiue interpretation of
                                    a Matrix. All elements containing zero will not be stored in order to achieve
                                    maximum time efficeny. The program will perform a number of operations on two inputted
                                    matricies and print the answers to the outfile. Once the program has been built, it can be executed with " /Sparse < in.txt >
                                    < out.txt > ". Input files should start with a line declaring the n by n size of both
                                    matrices, followed by the number of nnz for both matrices.
                                    The next lines will contain all elements to be added to the matrix in the format of
                                    int int double. Sparse will read the in file and perform the required operations. </p> 
								
								<h5> BigInt ADT </h5>
								<p class="mb-4"> This program will utilize the BigInteger ADT by allowing for addition, subtraction, and
                                    multiplaction on numbers larger than that which can be preformed by the basic C++ operators.
                                    The input file takes two signed or unsigned large numbers seperated by a blank line. The
                                    output file consists of a number of operations preformed on the two BigIntegers.  Once the program has been built, it can be executed with "./Arithmetic < in.txt > < out.txt >".</p> 

                                <h5> Dictionary ADT </h5>
								<p class="mb-4">This program will use the newly created list Dictionary ADT by accepting words in a line by line file,
                                    inputting the words into the ADT, and giving each a unique key. The dictionary will efficently store the words by
                                    utilizing a Binary Search Tree. The main file, Order.cpp, will output the Dictionary in an alphabetical format using
                                    an in order search as well as a preorder search. Once the program has been built, it can be executed with, " ./Order < infile > < outfile > ".</p>
